# GettingStartedWithRoboticsSoftware

1. I have made this repo to collate different resources required for a complete newbie, to get going with basic programming courses  at UMD
2. Every folder will have files connected to that folder's title
3. I hope one day this repo becomes a huge collection of tips, information and knowledge.
4. All topics are divided into directories of their own
5. Some topics are heavily overlapping , but have unique points of their own, so they get their own directories

# Disclaimer
1. I am not an author of a lot of these links , unless i specify it myself
2. I am only collating information publicly available via a google search
3. If you have any problem with the content, please reach out to me
